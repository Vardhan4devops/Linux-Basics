GREP: Global Regular Expression Print

------------------------------------------

grep <pattern> filename

e.g: grep hello file1

       grep Permit /etc/ssh/sshd_config (displays Permit word as it is in the file)

       grep -i PERMIT /etc/ssh/sshd_config (displays all cases of permit word)



Note: grep works only on files.





grep with pipe:

------------------

grep considers the out put of a command before the pipe as a file.

e.g: ls -l | grep environment (it displays environment word from out put of ls -l command)

e.g: ls -l | grep ^d (to display starting char is d, useful to find directories) 

e.g: grep ^t file1 (display text starting with t)
