user management:
-------------------------
whenever a user is created in Linux, the below things happen:
- home dir is created ()/home/username)
- unique uid & gid are given to user,
- an entry in /etc/passwd is created.

useradd - to create a user (e,g: useradd vardhan)
passwd vardhan - to enable password for vardhan
 
To enable password authentication:
---------------------------------------
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication yes

-- service sshd reload
